Recitation 1: Problem 1
----------------------

 1. Create a file "answer.txt".
 2. Execute the following code by hand 
   (as we do in the lecture videos), and write
   the output in your "answer.txt" file

//start of code
int main(void) {
   for (int i = 3; i <= 5; i++) {
      for (int j = 2; j <= 4; j++) {
        if (i % j == 0) {
          printf("%d is a multiple of %d\n",i,j);
        }
      }
    }
  return 0;
}
//end of code
 3. Check your work in part 2 by
    (a) Run the provided program, called test (which was compiled from this code),
        and redirect the output to the file  test.out:
            ./test > test.out
    (b) Use the diff command to compare the contents of test.out with
        the contents of your answer.txt file
           diff test.out answer.txt
        Note that if diff prints nothing, the files are the same.
        If there are differences, it will print them out with 
        < and > signs to indicate which file the differing lines are from
    (c) If your answer.txt file is no correct, retry the problem 
        and/or ask for help.  Repeat 2 and 3 until it is correct.

 4. Use svn add and svn commit to submit your answer.txt into subversion
