Write an algorithm, which takes one positive number (N) as a parameter,
and prints a V shape from *s, such that the resulting V
is N stars tall, with the sides of the V being at 45 degree angles.

For example, given the input of N=3, your algorithm should print

*   *
 * *
  *

Given the input of N=5, your algorithm should print


*       *
 *     *
  *   *
   * *
