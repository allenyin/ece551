Added valgrind clean IntMatrix.cpp.
Key Takeaways:
1) Arrays of pointers are declared differently than in python or matlab...remember to adhere strictly to the types.
2) Remember to initialize the member pointers.
3) delete() does not recursively call the destructors of the objects a member pointer points to.
4) If "rhs" is declared as "IntMatrix & rhs", and "rows" is of type "IntArray ** rows", the correct way to compare rhs's and rows' member rows is to compare the actual object:
    *(rows[i]) == rhs[i].
   rows[i] returns a pointer to IntArray, *(rows[i]) dereferences it and returns an actual IntArray. rhs[i] returns *(rhs[i]) as per operator[] overloading. Thus the comparison is legal.
