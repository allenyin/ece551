Your project proposals are due on Friday, October 11th (right before
fall break).  You should form groups of 2 or 3, and come up with 
a project idea in between now and then.  

In this directory, you will find a proposal.tex, which is a LaTeX
template for your proposal.  Please note that it is an example of
how your proposal should be written, not the scope of your project.

Remember that November we will transition back to the "traditional"
classroom, and your out of class time will be primarily dedicated
to the project.   This means, you should come up with something
that your team can accomplish in ~3.5 weeks.


Please note that you only need to submit the LaTeX, but it
should be correct LaTeX: running

  pdflatex proposal.tex

should produce a pdf with your proposal.  Please pdflatex your proposal
and ensure that the resulting pdf reflects what you want us to see
(in terms of both content and formatting).
